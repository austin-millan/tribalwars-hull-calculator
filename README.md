# tribalwars-hull-calculator

A utility script I wrote years ago for use in Tribalwars.

## About

It's a simple script that determines the set of coordinates that form a convex hull around a set of village input coordinates.

It is not very useful on it's own but could be extended to aid in tribe diplomacy planning, mergers, etc.
